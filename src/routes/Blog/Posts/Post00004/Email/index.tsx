	  mailboxes. Although there seems to be an issue with loading time when
	  extracting email information from a users mailbox. It takes on average
	  8.23 seconds to load the subject, sender, receiver, and html body of the
	  user's 20 most recent emails. Currently the functionality of the

	  <ul>
		<li>Sending emails</li>
		<li>Viewing mail data from all mailboxes</li>
	  </ul>
	  Nonetheless, The example code documented for python in the Gmail api is
	  written in python 2.7, as such much of the code is outdated. This has
	  resulted is us learning the internal workings of the api in order to re-write the code to
	  support python 3. Furthermore, We are unable to view plain text message
	  bodies only message bodies consisting of html.
